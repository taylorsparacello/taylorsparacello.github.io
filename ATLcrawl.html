<h2>eating my way around ATL using the Atlanta DiningOut Passbook</h2>

 <div class="maxlagers">
  <p>Max Lager's Wood-Fired Grill & Brewery  <span class="price">December 2, 2018</span><br />
  <small>To kick off the start of the new passbook, I went to Max Lager's Wood-Fired Grill & Brewery. The atmosphere was cozy and friendly. The appetizers all looked so good. I got the spinach and artichoke dip, which was fantastic. I got the Pasta Romano Sausage & Fennel as my main dish, and it was such a unique blnd of  flavors. It was great! This is a great place to come for some good handcrafted beer, hearty food, and a fun atmosphere. </small></p>
</div>

 <div class="industry">
  <p>Industry Tavern  <span class="price">October 27, 2018</span><br />
  <small>I absolutely loved this place. It's a great place to get great pizza and catch the sports game. I ordered the Margherita Pizza and was extremely pleased. It's one of the best pizza places in Buckhead. I would highly recommend Industry Tavern for anyone looking for a lively atmosphere and extraordinary pizza. </small></p>
</div>

 <div class="hook">
  <p>Hook Line & Schooner  <span class="price">October 21, 2018</span><br />
  <small>When I came across this place in the passbook, it looked like food I would find back home in New Orleans! We ordered chargrilled oysters to start, and boy were they full of garlic. Close to what I get at home but not quite. For my main course, I ordered stuffed shrimp. It was alright. I think I just have high standards when it comes to seafood since I come from such a seafood rich place. Overall, the atmosphere was cozy and welcoming and the food was enjoyable.</small></p>
</div>

 <div class="cowtippers">
  <p>Cowtippers Steaks & Spirits  <span class="price">September 27, 2018</span><br />
  <small>This place is so fun! It was free dessert friday, so I got this awesome rainbow cake to finish off my meal. I had the puulled pork plate with a side of baked beans. The beans were't traditional baked beans; they were more like chili. Overall, really fun environment, good food, and a friendly staff. </small></p>
</div>

 <div class="second">
  <p>Allora <span class="price">August 25, 2018</span><br />
  <small>I stopped here for a weekend brunch with my mom, and I ordered Chicken and Biscuit which came with a buttermilk biscuit, chicken tenders, and sausage gravy. It was just the homemade, belly-filling food I was craving. The environment was welcoming and had a modern, industrial design. The music was trendy and really put the finishing touch on a perfect brunch spot!</small></p>
</div>

<div class="third">
  <p>Kuroshio Midtown Sushi and Lounge <span class="price">August 24, 2018</span><br />
  <small>Located in the heart of Midtown Atlanta, Kuroshio has some of the best sushi around. I started off my meal with the Japanese Hot Rock with six cuts of seasoned beef tenderloin paired with garlic ponzu sauce. I've never tried the hot rock before, but I won't go here without getting it next time! For my main course, I ordered a simple shrimp tempora sushi with crab stick and spicy mayo on top. Great food, great staff, great vibe.</small></p>
</div> 

<div class="first">
  <p>La Fonda Latina <span class="price">July 27, 2018</span><br />
  <small>Bustling hangout with a patio serving amazing salsa, Cuban sandwiches, & other Mexican standards. Atmosphere was great; however the service was less than great. Pictured is the shrimp quesadilla with corn and cheese accompanied with black beans and rice. **This restaurant is not in the Atlanta Dining Passbook. </small></p>
